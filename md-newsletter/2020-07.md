## Personal
Got into Shadertoy, and through this back into graphics programming as a whole. Completed a bunch of resources on shaders and ray marching, and made a [few][171] shaders of my [own][172].

[Remade][166] Intrinsic Gravity after discovering the Demoscene, a subculture that builds demos (self-contained computer programs that produce audio-visuals).

Completed [Vulkan-Tutorial][167] and (after ~40 hours) I can render a triangle!

[Wrote][168] Fundamentals of the Vulkan Graphics API to get a better understanding of how all the pieces explained in Vulkan-Tutorial fit together. My post somehow made it to [#1 on r/Programming][169], and was [retweeted][170] by the official Vulkan Twitter account :)
