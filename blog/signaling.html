            <p>How would you convince somebody that you’re an expert in quantum mechanics?</p>
            <p>If you’re not an expert in this field, <em>you shouldn’t be able to effectively apply any method you can imagine.</em> If you could, then it wouldn’t be a useful signal.</p>
            <p>If I told you about Schrodinger’s cat to you right now, you probably wouldn’t think I’m a quantum physicist. If this wasn’t the case anybody could Google and trick you into thinking they more than they do.</p>
            <p>Signals are actions that demonstrate evolutionarily desirable traits or possessions, such as physical fitness, material wealth, or knowledge of quantum mechanics - which is seen as a signal of intelligence, a trait that is desirable to potential allies and mates.</p>
            <p>For a signal to be seen as honest, it has to be costly and public.</p>
            <p><strong>Effective signals are easy to do if they are honest and reflect traits or material you possess, and costly if not.</strong> If I actually was an expert in quantum mechanics, then showing you research papers that I’ve written would be a good signal.</p>
            <p><strong>Signals have to be public to benefit the one signaling.</strong> Donating $10,000 to fight breast cancer won’t convince anybody of your empathetic and pro-social nature unless people know about it.</p>
            <p>Signaling is a primary motive behind many of our behaviours such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Conversation: talking with others lets us signal our utility as a potential ally.</li>
            <li>Charity: donating shows that you have an excess of wealth, and that you’re somebody who will help their allies.</li>
            <li>Consumption: sharing that you went on an expensive vacation signals to others that you have an abundance of material wealth.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="conversations-are-opportunities-to-signal">Conversations are Opportunities to Signal</h2>
            <p>Without signaling, the usual explanation for why people have conversations is that it serves as a way to trade information. I tell you about the nearby berry bush, you tell me about the dangerous lion to the West. We cooperate through conversation, and we’re better off for it.</p>
            <p>There are a few problems with this line of reasoning.</p>
            <p><strong>People like talking more than listening.</strong> If we participated in conversations primarily to gain information, then you’d expect people to want to listen more than they speak. People almost always show the opposite behaviour.</p>
            <p><strong>Most people don’t keep track of any sort of conversational debt.</strong> If one of your friends teaches you a lot about quantum mechanics for hours, you might feel grateful, but I doubt that you’d experience an overwhelming need to repay any informational “debt”.</p>
            <p><strong>Relevance is important in conversations.</strong> If somebody told you that their farm was attacked by foxes, and you immediately responded by telling them about your recipe for tacos, you’d get a strange stare. Instead, maintaining relevance and conversational flow is always important. This doesn’t seem to follow from the idea that people have conversations to trade information.</p>
            <p>But through the lens of signaling, all these pieces of etiquette and conversational quirks make sense.</p>
            <p><strong>People have conversations to signal their utility as a potential ally and mate.</strong> Rather than conversation being a way to cooperatively share information, this suggests that conversation is largely a selfish behaviour. People talk to signal to others their material wealth, knowledge, and fitness.</p>
            <p>This explains why people like talking more than listening. Every time you speak you’re getting a chance to show the other people how great you are. If somebody mentions that they’re building a new house, you’ll be excited to show any knowledge you have on construction or design.</p>
            <p>People don’t track conversational debts. Instead, people often compete to talk as much they can. You don’t care if you’re helping somebody build a house and getting nothing in return. Them knowing that you were the one who helped them, demonstrating your value as a potential ally, is a large reward.</p>
            <p>Maintaining conversational flow is important. It would be too easy to throw random pieces of information out there otherwise. If you happen to know a lot about whatever just came up in conversation, that’s a signal to others that you probably know about a whole lot of other things as well.</p>
            <p>So why did I write this post?</p>
            <p>I’d like to think it was primarily because of my curiosity. Signaling has a lot of explanatory power when analyzing why people do certain things. But it also serves as an (attempted) signal of my intelligence.</p>
            <p>Hey, look at me! I’m the type of person who spends time learning and writing about human behaviour. I hope you think of me as a good potential ally.</p>
