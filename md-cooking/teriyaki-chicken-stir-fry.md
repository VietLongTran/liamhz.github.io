Great for meal prep _and_ your taste buds.

This is legit.

## Ingredients
_Scale based on the amount of chicken you're cooking._\
_1 lb of boneless chicken breast is enough for ~4 servings._

- 1 lb of boneless chicken breast
- 1 tbsp of cooking oil
- 1 tsp of grated ginger
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1.5 coups of uncooked jasmine rice
- 2.5 cups of water
- 12 oz of frozen stir fry vegetables
- 1/4 cup of soy sauce
- 2 tbsp of brown sugar
- 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil
- 2 sliced green onions

## Directions
1. Cut the chicken breast into small pieces, ~1/2 an inch cubed.
2. Add oil, garlic, and ginger to a large skillet. Cook on medium heat for 1 minute.
3. Add chicken pieces and cook until it isn't pink on the outside. Don't fully cook the chicken!
4. Add uncooked rice to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes.
5. Add water to the skillet and stir the whole thing. Make sure there's no rice stuck to the bottom.
6. Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to high, cover with a lid, and wait till it boils.
7. Once the water is boiling, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
8. In a separate bowl, prepare teriyaki sauce by stirring together the soy sauce, brown sugar, and sesame oil.
9. After it's simmered for 10 minutes, sprinkle the frozen vegetables on top, then place the lid back on.
10. After 5 minutes of simmering, drizzle the teriyaki sauce, and stir everything together.
11. Let it simmer for 5 minutes without heat, then sprinkle green onions on and serve.
