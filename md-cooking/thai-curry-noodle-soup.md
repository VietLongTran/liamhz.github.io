# Thai Curry Noodle Soup

</div>

A healthy version of instant noodles, Thai style. I eat this almost every day for lunch.

I typically prep 5 jars / servings at a time.

## Ingredients
_For 1 jar / serving_\
_See "Notes" section for items with a \*_

- Half a chicken bouillon cube*
- 1 tsp of fish sauce
- 1 tsp of brown sugar
- 1 tsp of chili garlic sauce
- 2 tsp of Thai red curry paste*
- 1/4 cup of coconut milk
- 5 medium shrimp
- 1 thinly sliced mushroom
- 1 handful of thick Asian noodles*
- 2 sliced green onions
- 1 lime wedge

## Directions
1. Boil 2 cups of water (multiplied by the number of servings you're making) in a pot.
2. Place a servings worth of all the ingredients into a jar, _except_ for the noodles, lime, and green onions.
3. Once the water is boiling, cook your noodles in it for 1 minute, than place them into a strainer and pour cold water onto it - until none of the noodles are hot.
4. Place a handful of noodles into the jar, and put the jar into the fridge.
5. Place the sliced green onions and lime wedges into a ziploc or separate jar and refrigerate them to keep fresh.
6. When ready to eat, boil water, pour it into the jar, wait two minutes before serving into a bowl, and then add a lime wedge and some green onions.

## Notes
- Thai red curry _paste_ can be bought in the Asian section of most grocery stores - and can be substituted with 1 tbsp of Thai red curry _sauce_.
- For me, a "handful" of noodles is where my thumb and middle finger just touch when wrapped around them.
- Don't fully cook the noodles before placing them in the jar! They'll soften when you pour boiling water into the jar before serving.
- If you can't find bouillon cubes, substitute it with 1/3 cup of chicken broth per jar.
